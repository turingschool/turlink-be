        Cor. x. 6.\n        [1913 Webster]\n  \n     5. An instance serving for illustration
        of a rule or precept,\n        especially a problem to be solved, or a case
        to be\n        determined, as an exercise in the application of the rules\n
        \       of any study or branch of science; as, in trigonometry and\n        grammar,
        the principles and rules are illustrated by\n        examples.\n  \n     Syn:
        Precedent; case; instance.\n  \n     Usage: Example, Instance. The discrimination
        to be made\n            between these two words relates to cases in which
        we\n            give \"instances\" or \"examples\" of things done. An\n            instance
        denotes the single case then \"standing\"\n            before us; if there
        be others like it, the word does\n            not express this fact. On the
        contrary, an example is\n            one of an entire class of like things,
        and should be a\n            true representative or sample of that class.
        Hence, an\n            example proves a rule or regular course of things;
        an\n            instance simply points out what may be true only in\n            the
        case presented. A man's life may be filled up with\n            examples of
        the self-command and kindness which marked\n            his character, and
        may present only a solitary\n            instance of haste or severity. Hence,
        the word\n            \"example\" should never be used to describe what stands\n
        \           singly and alone. We do, however, sometimes apply the\n            word
        instance to what is really an example, because we\n            are not thinking
        of the latter under this aspect, but\n            solely as a case which \"stands
        before us.\" See\n            Precedent.\n            [1913 Webster]\n\n\nFrom
